## <a id="troubleshot"></a> Troubleshoot

See the following sections for help with troubleshooting JMX Bridge for PCF. 

### <a id='dependency'></a>Dependency Error during Install##

You may see the following error if your installed version of Elastic Runtime is not compatible with the JMX Bridge version you are attempting to install: 

<%= image_tag("images/jmx-ert-install-depedency.png") %>

Follow the instructions below that correspond to your installed Elastic Runtime version:

* **Elastic Runtime 1.8.0 to 1.8.16**: 
   1. Download version 1.8.17 or later of the <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime">Elastic Runtime tile</a> and import it your Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.
   1. Click the newly added tile to review any configurable options. If you need guidance, refer to the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html">Installing Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> topic and choose your IaaS.
   1. Click **Apply Changes** to install both Elastic Runtime and JMX Bridge.
* **Elastic Runtime 1.8.17 or later**: Upgrade the JMX Bridge tile to <b>1.8.9</b> or later.  
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: There is a known issue with the older versions of JMX Bridge and the newer versions of Elastic Runtime. JMX Bridge 1.8.2 through 1.8.8 only work with Elastic Runtime 1.8.0 through 1.8.16.</p>


### <a id='no-metrics'></a>Missing Metrics from PCF Installation or Firehose
If you are not seeing expected metrics from Elastic Runtime in the JMX provider, verify that you installed Elastic Runtime prior to JMX Bridge. If JMX Bridge was installed first, perform the following steps:

1. SSH into the `opentsdb-firehose-nozzle` VM. For information about how to use the BOSH CLI to SSH into a VM, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).
1. Grant `sudo` access to the machine:
       <pre class="terminal">$ sudo -i</pre>
1. Restart the `opentsdb-firehose-nozzle` job. 
       <pre class="terminal">$ monit restart opentsdb-firehose-nozzle</pre>
       
### <a id='bosh-metrics'></a>Missing Bosh Metrics
If you are not seeing expected metrics from Bosh, Try the following:

1. Verify that the IP in `JMX Bridge` -> `Status` -> `JMX Provider` IP matches the value entered in
      `Ops Manager Director` -> `Director Config` -> `Metrics IP Address`
1. If still no bosh metrics are coming through the system, 
   please contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a>
