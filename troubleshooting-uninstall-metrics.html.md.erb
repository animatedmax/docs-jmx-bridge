<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The JMX Bridge tool (formerly Ops Metrics) is a JMX extension for Elastic Runtime. JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
Use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The JMX Bridge tool is composed of two virtual machines:

- The JMX Provider
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/loggregator/architecture.html)

To deploy JMX Bridge, see the [Deploying JMX Bridge](./deploy-metrics.html) topic.

## <a id='uninstall'></a>Uninstall JMX Bridge (formerly Ops Metrics) ##
See the [Deleting a Product](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/add-delete.html#del-prod) section of the [Adding and Deleting Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/customizing/add-delete.html) topic for details.

## <a id='no-metrics'></a>Missing Metrics from PCF Installation or Firehose ##
If you are not seeing expected metrics from Elastic Runtime in the JMX provider, verify that you installed Elastic Runtime prior to JMX Bridge. If JMX Bridge was installed first, perform the following steps:

1. SSH into the `opentsdb-firehose-nozzle` VM. For information about how to use the BOSH CLI to SSH into a VM, see [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html).
1. Grant `sudo` access to the machine:
       <pre class="terminal">$ sudo -i</pre>
1. Restart the `opentsdb-firehose-nozzle` job. 
       <pre class="terminal">$ monit restart opentsdb-firehose-nozzle</pre>
